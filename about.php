							<p>The project is about creating a platform for painters to display their work and for buyers
to communicate to browse and contact artists. The webpage basically displays the information
of the paintings and the detailed information about the painter. This projects acts as a medium
between artists and consumers. The platform will be an open for any artist to register and display
their artwork. This will be very helpful for new artists to display their artwork. So, if anyone has
passion for painting can register and upload their artwork and that will be available in the
website along with the details of the artist including their phone number so if anyone wants to
purchase the art can contact the artist.</p>
